# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
## Project Description 
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns and play the game on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## How to Play
 
1. Open the link in the project description.
2. The game will start, and Player 1 (X) will go first.
3. Click on an empty square on the grid to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
4. The game will alternate between Player 1 and Player 2 until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
5. If a player wins, their symbol will be displayed in a winning combination, and a message will announce the winner.
6. If the game ends in a draw, a message will announce the draw.
7. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
